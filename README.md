We are working on a meal planning app that will allow users to quickly find and prepare recipes suited to their induvidual lifestyle. Our goal is to make healthy eating and meal planning simple and intuitive

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/install/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup

In order to log in as an admin you will need to execute the following commands in the console :
python manage.py migrate 
python manage.py createsuperuser 

The first command will create the database tables, including where your user info will be stored.
The second command will prompt you to create a log in info. 

## Running

To launch the server you need to type:
python manage.py runserver in to console.
After this visit your localhost in a webbrowser of choice.
